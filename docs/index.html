                <p>Sirius is a prototype array-oriented GPU programming language with strong type safety features.</p>

                <p>These docs and the language itself are under construction. <span class = "asp">Anything written in this style is aspirational and not fully implemented.</span> Sirius in a nutshell:
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Python with types"-style syntax</li>
                        <li>Static type checking and inference within function boundaries</li>
                        <li>Imperative with opt-in mutability and some functional features</li>
                        <li>Parametric polymorphism</li>
                        <li><span class = "asp">Static array shape and access checks</span></li>
                        <li><span class = "asp">Array-oriented facilities like broadcasting and fancy indexing</li>
                        <li><span class = "asp">A fast GPU backend</span></li>
                        <li><span class = "asp">Python bindings and Jupyter integration</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>You can try out Sirius with the <a href = "./demo.html">in-browser demo</a> or by cloning <a href = "https://github.com/lorentzj/sirius">the git repository</a>.</p>

                <p>Learn more with a gradual <a href = "./type_system.html">intro to the type system design</a>, the standard library docs, or the project roadmap.</p>
